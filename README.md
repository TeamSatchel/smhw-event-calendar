# smhw-event-calendar

A small SPA on React

a simple Rails application which comprises an events calendar. This application will consist of an /events page which displays a weekly calendar highlighting the current date. Application users must be able to create an event which contains start and end date plus a description.
Furthermore, the created event should instantly show on the calendar along with some indication as to when the event starts and finishes. The image on the /events page provides an example of what we are looking for.
Given this requirement, candidates should create an EventsController with these actions: index, create.
Events should be saved in a backend store without refreshing the page.
